        <h1>Plastic Watter Bottle</h1>

        <p>While most plastics are recycable plastic water bottles are an intersting case. The bottle
            part of a water bottle is recycable, however the cap is not. The cap is made of unrecycable plastic
            and must be thrown in the garbage.
