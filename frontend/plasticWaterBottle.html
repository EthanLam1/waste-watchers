                    <p>Plastic Water Bottles can be thrown into the recycling bin becasue they consist
                        of plastic and paper which are both recyclable. A common misconception about plastic water 
                        bottles is that you cannot recycle the cap. While recycling facilities used to not be able
                        to prosses the caps, they have advanced enought to prosses them.
